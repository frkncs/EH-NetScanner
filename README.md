<h3>I started to make python projects for my Cyber Security life</h3>
<p>Because I loved the ethical hacking and I have the mindset of an hacker. So I started to learn Python just for specificly for Ethical Hacking. I'm writing "EH" to beginning of the projects that I made for all my ethical hacking learning projects</p>
<p>This rule is not for my "All Projects" because after I started to write my own tools, I'll name them as a tool name</p>
